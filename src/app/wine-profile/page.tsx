          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={ { __html: `<p>When I taste wine, I like to break it down into several key dimensions. Each wine sits somewhere on a spectrum — from low to high, light to powerful. By placing a wine along these spectrums, we can clearly understand its personality.</p><p>Below are the main characteristics I use when evaluating wine.
<h2>1. Sweetness</h2>
Sweetness describes how much residual sugar remains in the wine.</p><p>The spectrum usually looks like this:</p><p>Dry → Off-dry → Sweet → Dessert wine</p><p>The wines I enjoy sit very close to the <strong>dry end of the spectrum</strong>.
This means they contain little to no sugar and feel crisp rather than sweet.</p><p>Dry wines allow the other elements of wine — tannin, acidity, structure, and flavor — to stand out more clearly.
<h2>2. Tannin</h2>
Tannins are natural compounds extracted from grape skins, seeds, and oak barrels.</p><p>They create that <strong>drying sensation in your mouth</strong>, similar to strong black tea.</p><p>The spectrum:</p><p>Low tannin → Medium tannin → High tannin</p><p>The wines I prefer tend to have <strong>medium-high to high tannins</strong>.</p><p>High tannin wines usually:</p><p>• feel more structured
• pair well with meat
• age well over time</p><p>This is why many powerful red wines improve after several years of aging.
<h2>3. Acidity</h2>
Acidity is what gives wine its freshness and brightness.</p><p>Low-acidity wines feel round and soft.
High-acidity wines feel sharp and lively.</p><p>The spectrum:</p><p>Low acidity → Medium acidity → High acidity</p><p>My preference sits around <strong>low to medium acidity</strong>.
I tend to enjoy wines that feel <strong>smooth and round rather than sharp or sour</strong>.
<h2>4. Body</h2>
Body describes the <strong>weight or richness of the wine in your mouth</strong>.</p><p>Think of it like milk:</p><p>• skim milk → light body
• whole milk → medium body
• cream → full body</p><p>The wines I enjoy are clearly <strong>full-bodied</strong>.</p><p>Full-bodied wines feel rich, dense, and powerful.
<h2>5. Alcohol</h2>
Alcohol also influences the body and warmth.</p><p>Most wines fall between:</p><p>8% → 16%</p><p>My preference is toward the <strong>higher end of the spectrum</strong>, usually around:</p><p>13.5% – 15.5%</p><p>Higher alcohol wines often feel bolder and more intense.
<h2>6. Flavor Intensity</h2>
Some wines are subtle and delicate.</p><p>Others are bold and explosive.</p><p>The spectrum:</p><p>Light flavors → Medium → Intense</p><p>The wines I enjoy are clearly <strong>high intensity</strong>.</p><p>Typical flavor notes I like include:</p><p>• blackberry
• black pepper
• dark chocolate
• smoke
• oak/wood</p><p>These flavors are typical of powerful red wines.
<h2>7. Complexity</h2>
Complexity refers to the number of layers of aroma and flavor a wine has.</p><p>Simple wines usually have one or two dominant notes.</p><p>Complex wines evolve as you smell and taste them.</p><p>You might notice:</p><p>• fruit
• spice
• earth
• oak
• leather
• chocolate</p><p>The wines I prefer tend to be <strong>complex</strong>, revealing new layers over time.
<h2>8. Finish</h2>
The finish is how long the flavor remains after swallowing.</p><p>Short finish: disappears quickly
Medium finish: lingers briefly
Long finish: stays in your mouth for a long time</p><p>High-quality wines usually have a <strong>long finish</strong>, which is something I strongly enjoy.

In simple terms:</p><p>I enjoy <strong>bold, powerful, full-bodied red wines with deep flavors and structure</strong>.</p><p>
